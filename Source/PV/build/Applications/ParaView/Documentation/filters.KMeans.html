      This filter either computes a statistical model of a dataset or takes
      such a model as its second input. Then, the model (however it is
      obtained) may optionally be used to assess the input dataset.&lt;p&gt;
      This filter iteratively computes the center of k clusters in a space
      whose coordinates are specified by the arrays you select. The clusters
      are chosen as local minima of the sum of square Euclidean distances from
      each point to its nearest cluster center. The model is then a set of
      cluster centers. Data is assessed by assigning a cluster center and
      distance to the cluster to each point in the input data
      set.</div>

        model of the &lt;b&gt;entire&lt;/b&gt; input dataset;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt; "Model a subset of the data," creates an output table (or
        tables) summarizing a &lt;b&gt;randomly-chosen subset&lt;/b&gt; of the
        input dataset;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; "Assess the data with a model,"
        adds attributes to the first input dataset using a model provided on
        the second input port; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; "Model and assess the
        same data," is really just operations 2 and 3 above applied to the same
        input dataset. The model is first trained using a fraction of the input
        data and then the entire dataset is assessed using that
        model.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; When the task includes creating a model
        (i.e., tasks 2, and 4), you may adjust the fraction of the input
        dataset used for training. You should avoid using a large fraction of
        the input data for training as you will then not be able to detect
        overfitting. The &lt;i&gt;Training fraction&lt;/i&gt; setting will be
        ignored for tasks 1 and 3.</td>
