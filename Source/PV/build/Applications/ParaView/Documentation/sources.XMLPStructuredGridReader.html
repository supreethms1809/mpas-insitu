                     The XML Partitioned Structured Grid reader reads the
                     partitioned VTK structured grid data file format. It reads
                     the partitioned format's summary file and then the
                     associated VTK XML structured grid data files. The
                     expected file extension is .pvts. This reader also
                     supports file series.</div>
