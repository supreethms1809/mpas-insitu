      The Glyph filter generates a glyph at each point in the input dataset.
      The glyphs can be oriented and scaled by the input point-centered scalars
      and vectors. The Glyph filter operates on any type of data set. Its
      output is polygonal. This filter is available on the
      Toolbar.</div>
