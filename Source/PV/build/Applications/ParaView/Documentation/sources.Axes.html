            <p>Three lines representing the axes - red line along X, green line along Y, and blue line along Z</p>

                     The Axes source can be used to add a representation of the
                     coordinate system axes to the 3D scene. The X axis will be
                     drawn as a blue line, the Y axis as a green line, and the
                     Z axis as a red line. The axes can be drawn either as
                     three lines drawn in the positive direction from the
                     origin or as three lines crossing at the origin (drawn in
                     both the positive and negative directions). The output of
                     the Axes source is polygonal data. This polygonal data has
                     a scalar per line so that the lines can be colored. It
                     also has normals defined.</div>
