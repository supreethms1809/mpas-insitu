            <p>This filter merges cells and converts the data set to unstructured grid.</p>
        </i>
        <div class="description">Merges degenerate cells. Assumes
                     the input grid does not contain duplicate points. You may
                     want to run vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid first to assert it.
                     If duplicated cells are found they are removed in the
                     output. The filter also handles the case, where a cell may
                     contain degenerate nodes (i.e. one and the same node is
                     referenced by a cell more than once).</div>
