        <h2>Nrrd Reader (NrrdReader)</h2>
        <i>
            <p>Reads raw image files with Nrrd meta data.</p>
        </i>
        <div class="description">The
                     Nrrd reader reads raw image data much like the Raw Image
                     Reader except that it will also read metadata information
                     in the Nrrd format. This means that the reader will
                     automatically set information like file dimensions. There
                     are several limitations on what type of nrrd files we can
                     read. This reader only supports nrrd files in raw format.
                     Other encodings like ascii and hex will result in errors.
                     When reading in detached headers, this only supports
                     reading one file that is detached.</div>

        when reading from a large data set and you are only interested in a
        small portion of the data. If left containing all 0's, then the reader
        will load in the entire data set.</td>
