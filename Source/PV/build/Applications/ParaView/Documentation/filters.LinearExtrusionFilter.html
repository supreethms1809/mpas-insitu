                     operates on polygonal data and produces polygonal data

        ends of the swept surface. Capping works by placing a copy of the input
        dataset on either end of the swept surface, so it behaves properly if
        the input is a 2D surface composed of filled polygons. If the input
        dataset is a closed solid (e.g., a sphere), then if capping is on
        (i.e., this property is set to 1), two copies of the data set will be
        displayed on output (the second translated from the first one along the
        specified vector). If instead capping is off (i.e., this property is
        set to 0), then an input closed solid will produce no
        output.</td>

        will be the same regardless of the number of processors used to compute
        the result. The difference is whether there are internal polygonal
        faces on the processor boundaries. A value of 1 will keep the results
        the same; a value of 0 will allow internal faces on processor
        boundaries.</td>
