The main goal of this reader is to make it easy to read PLOT3D files,
specifically time series of PLOT3D files. PLOT3D files can take many
different forms based on their content. Unfortunately, it is not a
self-describing format therefore the user needs to pass information
about the contents of the file to the reader. Normally, this is done
by setting a number of member variables. The goal of this reader is to
provide a simple format that enable the writer of the PLOT3D file to
describe its settings as well as group a number of files as a time
series.
