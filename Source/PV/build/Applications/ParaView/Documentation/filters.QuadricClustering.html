        <i>
            <p>This filter is the same filter used to generate level of detail for ParaView.  It uses a structured grid of bins and merges all points contained in each bin.</p>
        </i>
        <div class="description">The Quadric
                     Clustering filter produces a reduced-resolution polygonal
                     approximation of the input polygonal dataset. This filter
                     is the one used by ParaView for computing LODs. It uses
                     spatial binning to reduce the number of points in the data
                     set; points that lie within the same spatial bin are
                     collapsed into one representative point.</div>
