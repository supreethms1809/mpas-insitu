        <div class="description">The Temporal
                     Shift Scale filter linearly transforms the time values of
                     a pipeline object by applying a shift and then scale.
                     Given a data at time t on the input, it will be
                     transformed to time t*Shift + Scale on the output.
                     Inversely, if this filter has a request for time t, it
                     will request time (t-Shift)/Scale on its
                     input.</div>

                <td>If Periodic is true, requests for time will be wrapped
        around so that the source appears to be a periodic time source. If data
        exists for times {0,N-1}, setting periodic to true will cause time 0 to
        be produced when time N, 2N, 2N etc is requested. This effectively
        gives the source the ability to generate time data indefinitely in a
        loop. When combined with Shift/Scale, the time becomes periodic in the
        shifted and scaled time frame of reference. Note: Since the input time
        may not start at zero, the wrapping of time from the end of one period
        to the start of the next, will subtract the initial time - a source
        with T{5..6} repeated periodicaly will have output time {5..6..7..8}
        etc.</td>

        scaled/shifted actual time) and time 1 is the same as time 0 so that
        steps will be 0,1,2,3...N,1,2,3...N,1,2,3 where step N is the same as 0
        and step 0 is not repeated. When this flag is false the data is assumed
