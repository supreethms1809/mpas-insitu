                     The Smooth filter operates on a polygonal data set by
                     iteratively adjusting the position of the points using
                     Laplacian smoothing. (Because this filter only adjusts
                     point positions, the output data set is also polygonal.)
                     This results in better-shaped cells and more evenly
                     distributed points. The Convergence slider limits the
                     maximum motion of any point. It is expressed as a fraction
                     of the length of the diagonal of the bounding box of the
                     data set. If the maximum point motion during a smoothing
                     iteration is less than the Convergence value, the
                     smoothing operation terminates.</div>
