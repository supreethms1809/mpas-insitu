        <i>
            <p>This filter cuts a data set with a plane or sphere.  Cutting is similar to a contour.  It creates surfaces from volumes and lines from surfaces.</p>

        <div class="description">The
                     Generic Cut filter extracts the portion of the input data
                     set that lies along the specified plane or sphere. From
                     the Cut Function menu, you can select whether cutting will
                     be performed with a plane or a sphere. The appropriate 3D
                     widget (plane widget or sphere widget) will be displayed.
                     The parameters of the cut function can be specified
                     interactively using the 3D widget or manually using the
                     traditional user interface controls. Instructions for
                     using these 3D widgets and their corresponding user
                     interfaces are found in section 7.4. By default, the cut
                     lies on the specified plane or sphere. Using the Cut
                     Offset Values portion of the interface, it is also
                     possible to cut the data set at some offset from the
                     original cut function. The Cut Offset Values are in the
                     spatial units of the data set. To add a single offset,
                     select the value from the New Value slider in the Add
                     value portion of the interface and click the Add button,
                     or press Enter. To instead add several evenly spaced
                     offsets, use the controls in the Generate range of values
                     section. Select the number of offsets to generate using
                     the Number of Values slider. The Range slider controls the
                     interval in which to generate the offsets. Once the number
                     of values and range have been selected, click the Generate
                     button. The new offsets will be added to the Offset Values
                     list. To delete a value from the Cut Offset Values list,
                     select the value and click the Delete button. (If no value
                     is selected, the last value in the list will be removed.)
                     Clicking the Delete All button removes all the values in
                     the list. The Generic Cut filter takes a generic dataset
                     as input. Use the Input menu to choose a data set to cut.
                     The output of this filter is polygonal
                     data.</div>
