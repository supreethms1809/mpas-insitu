        <div class="description">
                     WindBlade/Firetec is a simulation dealing with the effects
                     of wind on wind turbines or on the spread of fires. It
                     produces three outputs - a StructuredGrid for the wind
                     data fields, a StructuredGrid for the ground topology, and
                     a PolyData for turning turbine blades. The input file
                     (.wind) opened by the WindBlade reader is an ASCII
                     description of the data files expected. Data is
                     accumulated by the simulation processor and is written one
                     file per time step. WindBlade can deal with topology if a
                     flag is turned on and expects (x,y) data for the ground.
                     It also can deal with turning wind turbines from other
                     time step data files which gives polygon positions of
                     segments of the blades and data for each
                     segment.</div>
