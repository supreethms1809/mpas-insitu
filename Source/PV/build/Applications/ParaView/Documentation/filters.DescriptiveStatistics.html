            <p>Compute a statistical model of a dataset and/or assess the dataset with a statistical model.</p>

        <div class="description">
      This filter either computes a statistical model of a dataset or takes
      such a model as its second input. Then, the model (however it is
      obtained) may optionally be used to assess the input dataset.&lt;p&gt;
      This filter computes the min, max, mean, raw moments M2 through M4,
      standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis for each array you
      select.&lt;p&gt; The model is simply a univariate Gaussian distribution
      with the mean and standard deviation provided. Data is assessed using
      this model by detrending the data (i.e., subtracting the mean) and then
      dividing by the standard deviation. Thus the assessment is an array whose
      entries are the number of standard deviations from the mean that each
      input point lies.</div>

        model of the &lt;b&gt;entire&lt;/b&gt; input dataset;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt; "Model a subset of the data," creates an output table (or
        tables) summarizing a &lt;b&gt;randomly-chosen subset&lt;/b&gt; of the
        input dataset;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; "Assess the data with a model,"
        adds attributes to the first input dataset using a model provided on
        the second input port; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; "Model and assess the
        same data," is really just operations 2 and 3 above applied to the same
        input dataset. The model is first trained using a fraction of the input
        data and then the entire dataset is assessed using that
        model.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; When the task includes creating a model
        (i.e., tasks 2, and 4), you may adjust the fraction of the input
        dataset used for training. You should avoid using a large fraction of
        the input data for training as you will then not be able to detect
        overfitting. The &lt;i&gt;Training fraction&lt;/i&gt; setting will be
        ignored for tasks 1 and 3.</td>
