        <div class="description">This filter
                     generates surface normals at the points of the input
                     polygonal dataset to provide smooth shading of the
                     dataset. The resulting dataset is also polygonal. The
                     filter works by calculating a normal vector for each
                     polygon in the dataset and then averaging the normals at
                     the shared points.</div>

        back-facing ones, and vice versa. You might want to do this if your
