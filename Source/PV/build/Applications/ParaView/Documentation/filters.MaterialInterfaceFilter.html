        <h2>Material Interface Filter (MaterialInterfaceFilter)</h2>
        <i>
            <p>The Material Interface filter finds volumes in the input data containg material above a certain material fraction.</p>
        </i>
        <div class="description">
      The Material Interface filter finds voxels inside of which a material
      fraction (or normalized amount of material) is higher than a given
      threshold. As these voxels are identified surfaces enclosing adjacent
      voxels above the threshold are generated. The resulting volume and its
      surface are what we call a fragment. The filter has the ability to
      compute various volumetric attributes such as fragment volume, mass,
      center of mass as well as volume and mass weighted averages for any of
      the fields present. Any field selected for such computation will be also
      be coppied into the fragment surface's point data for visualization. The
      filter also has the ability to generate Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) for
      each fragment. The data generated by the filter is organized in three
      outputs. The "geometry" output, containing the fragment surfaces. The
      "statistics" output, containing a point set of the centers of mass. The
      "obb representaion" output, containing OBB representations (poly data).
      All computed attributes are coppied into the statistics and geometry
      output. The obb representation output is used for validation and
      debugging puproses and is turned off by default. To measure the size of
      craters, the filter can invert a volume fraction and clip the volume
      fraction with a sphere and/or a plane.</div>

        threshold, these voxel's mass will be used in fragment center of mass
        and mass calculation. A warning is generated if no mass array is
        selected for an individual material fraction array. However, in that
