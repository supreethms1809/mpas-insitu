        <div class="description">
      Writer to write polygonal data in Stanford University PLY format. The
      data can be written in either binary (little or big endian) or ASCII
      representation. As for PointData and CellData, vtkPLYWriter cannot handle
      normals or vectors. It only handles RGB PointData and CellData. This
      version is used when running in parallel. It gathers data to first node
      and saves one file.</div>
