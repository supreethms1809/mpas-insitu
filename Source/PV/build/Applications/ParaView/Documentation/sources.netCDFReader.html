        <i>
            <p>Reads regular arrays from netCDF files. Will also read any topological information specified by the COARDS and CF conventions.</p>

        <div class="description">Reads
                     arrays from netCDF files into structured VTK data sets. In
                     the absence of any other information, the files will be
                     read as image data. This reader will also look for meta
                     information specified by the CF convention that specify
                     things like topology and time. This information can cause
                     the output to be a nonuniform rectilinear grid or
                     curvilinear (structured) grid. Details on the CF
                     convention can be found at http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/. It
                     should be noted that the CF convention is a superset of
                     the COARDS convention, so COARDS conventions will also be
                     recognized.</div>
