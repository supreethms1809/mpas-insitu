                     tessellates cells with nonlinear geometry and/or scalar
                     fields into a simplicial complex with linearly
                     interpolated field values that more closely approximate
                     the original field. This is useful for datasets containing
                     quadratic cells.</div>

        and 1D cells produce line segments. When the value is 2, 3D cells will

        vertices will be merged after tessellation has occurred. Only geometry
        is considered during the merge and the first vertex encountered is the
        one whose point attributes will be used. Any discontinuities in point
        fields will be lost. On the other hand, many operations, such as
        streamline generation, require coincident vertices to be merged. Toggle
        whether to merge coincident vertices.</td>
