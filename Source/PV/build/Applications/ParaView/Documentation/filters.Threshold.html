                     The Threshold filter extracts the portions of the input
                     dataset whose scalars lie within the specified range. This
                     filter operates on either point-centered or cell-centered
                     data. This filter operates on any type of dataset and
                     produces unstructured grid output. To select between these
                     two options, select either Point Data or Cell Data from
                     the Attribute Mode menu. Once the Attribute Mode has been
                     selected, choose the scalar array from which to threshold
                     the data from the Scalars menu. The Lower Threshold and
                     Upper Threshold sliders determine the range of the scalars
                     to retain in the output. The All Scalars check box only
                     takes effect when the Attribute Mode is set to Point Data.
                     If the All Scalars option is checked, then a cell will
                     only be passed to the output if the scalar values of all
                     of its points lie within the range indicated by the Lower
                     Threshold and Upper Threshold sliders. If unchecked, then
                     a cell will be added to the output if the specified scalar
                     value for any of its points is within the chosen
                     range.</div>

          If off, the vertex scalars are treated as a discrete set. If on, they
          are treated as a continuous interval over the minimum and maximum. One
          important "on" use case: When setting lower and upper threshold
          equal to some value and turning AllScalars off, the results are
          cells containing the iso-surface for that value.  WARNING: Whether on
          or off, for higher order input, the filter will not give accurate
          results.
