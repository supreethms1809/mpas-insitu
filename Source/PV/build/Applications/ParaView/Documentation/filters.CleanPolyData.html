                     unused points, and transform degenerate cells into their
                     appropriate forms (e.g., a triangle is converted into a
                     line if two of its points are merged).</div>

        piece at a time, so it is not necessary for the entire data set to fit
        into memory; however the results are not guaranteed to be the same as
        they would be if the Piece invariant option was on. Setting this option
