        <h2>Mandelbrot (ImageMandelbrotSource)</h2>
        <i>
            <p>Representation (unsigned char) of the Mandlebrot set in up to 3 dimensions</p>
        </i>
        <div class="description">The
                     Mandelbrot source can be used to add a uniform rectilinear
                     grid with scalar values derived from the Mandelbrot set to
                     the 3D scene. The equation used is z = z^2 + C (where z
                     and C are complex, and C is a constant). The scalar values
                     in the grid are the number of iterations of the equation
                     it takes for the magnitude of the value to become greater
                     than 2. In the equation, the initial value of z is 0. By
                     default, the real component of C is mapped onto the X
                     axis; the imaginary component of C is mapped onto the Y
                     axis; and the imaginary component of the initial value is
                     mapped onto the Z axis. If a two-dimensional extent is
                     specified, the resulting image will be displayed. If a
                     three-dimensional extent is used, then the bounding box of
                     the volume will be displayed. The output of the Mandelbrot
                     source is image (uniform rectilinear)
                     data.</div>

        0) is mapped to the X axis; the imaginary component of C (represented
        by 1) is mapped to the Y axis; and the real component of X, the initial
        value (represented by 2) is mapped to the Z axis. The imaginary
