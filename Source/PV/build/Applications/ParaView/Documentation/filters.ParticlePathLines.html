        Particle Pathlines takes any dataset as input, it extracts the
        point locations of all cells over time to build up a polyline
        trail.  The point number (index) is used as the 'key' if the points
        are randomly changing their respective order in the points list,
        then you should specify a scalar that represents the unique
        ID. This is intended to handle the output of a filter such as the
        TemporalStreamTracer.

          Set a second input, which is a selection. Particles with the same
          Id in the selection as the primary input will be chosen for
          pathlines Note that you must have the same IdChannelArray in the
          selection as the input

                <td>
          Set the number of particles to track as a ratio of the input.
          Example: setting MaskPoints to 10 will track every 10th point.

                <th>MaxTrackLength</th>
                <td>
          If the Particles being traced animate for a long time, the trails
          or traces will become long and stringy. Setting the
          MaxTraceTimeLength will limit how much of the trace is
          displayed. Tracks longer then the Max will disappear and the
          trace will apppear like a snake of fixed length which progresses
          as the particle moves.  This length is given with respect to
          timesteps.

                <th>MaxStepDistance</th>
                <td>
            If a particle disappears from one end of a simulation and
            reappears on the other side, the track left will be
            unrepresentative.  Set a MaxStepDistance{x,y,z} which acts as a
            threshold above which if a step occurs larger than the value (for
            the dimension), the track will be dropped and restarted after the
            step. (ie the part before the wrap around will be dropped and the
            newer part kept).

            <tr>
                <th>IdChannelArray</th>
                <td>
            Specify the name of a scalar array which will be used to fetch
            the index of each point. This is necessary only if the particles
            change position (Id order) on each time step. The Id can be used
            to identify particles at each step and hence track them properly.
            If this array is set to "Global or Local IDs", the global point
            ids are used if they exist or the point index is otherwise.
