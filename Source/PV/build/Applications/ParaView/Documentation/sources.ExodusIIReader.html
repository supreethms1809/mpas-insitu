        <h2>ExodusIIReader (ExodusIIReader)</h2>
        <i>
            <p>Reads an Exodus II file to produce an unstructured grid.</p>
        </i>
        <div class="description">The Exodus reader loads
                     Exodus II files and produces an unstructured grid output.
                     The default file extensions are .g, .e, .ex2, .ex2v2,
                     .exo, .gen, .exoII, .exii, .0, .00, .000, and .0000. The
                     file format is described fully at:
                     http://endo.sandia.gov/SEACAS/Documentation/exodusII.pdf.
                     Each Exodus file contains a single set of points with 2-D
                     or 3-D coordinates plus one or more blocks, sets, and
                     maps. Block group elements (or their bounding edges or
                     faces) of the same type together. Sets select subsets
                     (across all the blocks in a file) of elements, sides of
                     elements (which may be of mixed dimensionality), bounding
                     faces of volumetric elements, or bounding edges of
                     volumetric or areal elements. Each block or set may have
                     multiple result variables, each of which defines a value
                     per element, per timestep. The elements (cells), faces of
                     elements (when enumerated in face blocks), edges of
                     elements (when enumerated in edge blocks), and nodes
                     (points) in a file may be assigned an arbitrary integer
                     number by an element map, face map, edge map, or node map,
                     respectively. Usually, only a single map of each type
                     exists and is employed to assign a unique global ID to
                     entities across multiple files which partition a large
                     mesh for a distributed-memory calculation. However here
                     may be multiply maps of each type and there are no
                     constraints which force the integers to be unique. The
                     connectivity of elements is constant across all of the
                     timesteps in any single Exodus II file. However, multiple
                     files which specify a single time-evolution of a mesh may
                     be used to represent meshes which exhibit changes in
                     connectivity infrequently. Field variable mode_shape[0]
                     represents the time step (t_index) if HasModeShapes is
                     not set or the ModeShape otherwise.</div>
