        <div class="description">The Temporal Cache
                     can be used to save multiple copies of a data set at
                     different time steps to prevent thrashing in the pipeline
                     caused by downstream filters that adjust the requested
                     time step. For example, assume that there is a downstream
                     Temporal Interpolator filter. This filter will (usually)
                     request two time steps from the upstream filters, which in
                     turn (usually) causes the upstream filters to run twice,
                     once for each time step. The next time the interpolator
                     requests the same two time steps, they might force the
                     upstream filters to re-evaluate the same two time steps.
                     The Temporal Cache can keep copies of both of these time
                     steps and provide the requested data without having to run
                     upstream filters.</div>
