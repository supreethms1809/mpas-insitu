                     reader reads a Delimited Text values file into a 1D
                     rectilinear grid. If the file was saved using the
                     CSVWriter, then the rectilinear grid's points and point
                     data can be restored as well as the cell data. Otherwise
                     all the data in the CSV file is treated as cell data. The
                     default file extension is .csv as well as .txt.
                     This can read file series as well.</div>
