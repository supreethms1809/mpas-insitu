      The Superquadric source can be used to add a polygonal superquadric to
      the 3D scene. This source can be used to create a wide variety of shapes
      (e.g., a sphere, a box, or a torus) by adjusting the roundness
      parameters. The output of the Superquadric source is polygonal data with
      point normals and texture coordinates defined.</div>
