        <h2>Triangulate (TriangleFilter)</h2>
        <i>
            <p>This filter converts polygons and triangle strips to basic triangles.</p>
        </i>
        <div class="description">The
                     Triangulate filter decomposes polygonal data into only
                     triangles, points, and lines. It separates triangle strips
                     and polylines into individual triangles and lines,
                     respectively. The output is polygonal data. Some filters
                     that take polygonal data as input require that the data be
                     composed of triangles rather than other polygons, so
                     passing your data through this filter first is useful in
                     such situations. You should use this filter in these cases
                     rather than the Tetrahedralize filter because they produce
                     different output dataset types. The filters referenced
                     require polygonal input, and the Tetrahedralize filter
                     produces unstructured grid output.</div>
