        DICOM is a file format often used in medical imaging. This version
        of the reader will look at all files in the same directory of the
        selected file and load them as planes of the same data set. It is
        typically for 3D medical scanners to store planes as set of files
        in a directory.

          A file in the directory of files to be loaded. The DICOM reader
          will actually load all valid DICOM files in the same directory as
          this file as part of the same dataset. This is typical of how
          DICOM files are often stored.
