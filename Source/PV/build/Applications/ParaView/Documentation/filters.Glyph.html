            <p>This filter produces a glyph at each point of in input data set.  The glyphs can be oriented and scaled by point attributes of the input dataset.</p>
        </i>
        <div class="description">
The Glyph filter generates a glyph (i.e., an arrow, cone, cube,
cylinder, line, sphere, or 2D glyph) at each point in the input
dataset. The glyphs can be oriented and scaled by the input
point-centered scalars and vectors. The Glyph filter operates on any
type of data set. Its output is polygonal
<p>
To use this filter, you first select the arrays to use for as the
<b>Scalars</b> and <b>Vectors</b>, if any.  To orient the glyphs using the
selected <b>Vectors</b>, use <b>Orient</b> property.  To scale the glyphs using
the selected <b>Scalars</b> or <b>Vectors</b>, use the <b>Scale Mode</b> property.
<p>
The <b>Glyph Mode</b> property controls which points in the input dataset
are selected for glyphing (since in most cases, glyping all points in
the input dataset can be both performance impeding as well as visually
cluttred.
