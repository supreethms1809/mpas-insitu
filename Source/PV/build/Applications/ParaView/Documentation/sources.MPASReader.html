                     This reader reads unstructured grid MPAS data from a file.
                     It creates a dual grid It assumes the grid is in the
                     global domain. By default, it creates a spherical view of
                     vertical layer 0. It assumes it is ocean data. It gives
                     several options to change the view to multilayer (all
                     vertical layers will have a thickness determined by the
                     value in the slider), lat/lon projection or atmospheric
                     (vertical layers go out away from the center of the
                     sphere, instead of down towards the center as they do for
                     ocean data). It doesn't handle data in the rectangular
                     domain. This is not a parallel reader. It expects one .nc
                     file of data. It can display cell or vertex-centered data,
                     but not edge data. When converted to the dual grid,
                     cell-centered data becomes vertex-centered and vice-versa.
                     NOTES: When using this reader, it is important that you
                     remember to do the following: 1. When changing a selected
                     variable, remember to select it also in the drop down box
                     to color by. It doesn't color by that variable
                     automatically 2. When selecting multilayer sphere view,
                     start with layer thickness around 100,000 3. When
                     selecting multilayer lat/lon view, start with layer
                     thickness around 10 4. Always click the -Z orientation
                     after making a switch from lat/lon to sphere, from single
                     to multilayer or changing thickness. 5. Be conservative on
                     the number of changes you make before hitting Apply, since
                     there may be bugs in this reader. Just make one change and
                     then hit Apply. For problems, contact Christine Ahrens
