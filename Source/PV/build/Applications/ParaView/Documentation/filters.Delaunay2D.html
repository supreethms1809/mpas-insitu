                     Delaunay2D is a filter that constructs a 2D Delaunay
                     triangulation from a list of input points. These points
                     may be represented by any dataset of type vtkPointSet and
                     subclasses. The output of the filter is a polygonal
                     dataset containing a triangle mesh. The 2D Delaunay
                     triangulation is defined as the triangulation that
                     satisfies the Delaunay criterion for n-dimensional
                     simplexes (in this case n=2 and the simplexes are
                     triangles). This criterion states that a circumsphere of
                     each simplex in a triangulation contains only the n+1
                     defining points of the simplex. In two dimensions, this
                     translates into an optimal triangulation. That is, the
                     maximum interior angle of any triangle is less than or
                     equal to that of any possible triangulation. Delaunay
                     triangulations are used to build topological structures
                     from unorganized (or unstructured) points. The input to
                     this filter is a list of points specified in 3D, even
                     though the triangulation is 2D. Thus the triangulation is
                     constructed in the x-y plane, and the z coordinate is
                     ignored (although carried through to the output). You can
                     use the option ProjectionPlaneMode in order to compute the
                     best-fitting plane to the set of points, project the
                     points and that plane and then perform the triangulation
                     using their projected positions and then use it as the
                     plane in which the triangulation is performed. The
                     Delaunay triangulation can be numerically sensitive in
                     some cases. To prevent problems, try to avoid injecting
                     points that will result in triangles with bad aspect
                     ratios (1000:1 or greater). In practice this means
                     inserting points that are "widely dispersed", and enables
                     smooth transition of triangle sizes throughout the mesh.
                     (You may even want to add extra points to create a better
                     point distribution.) If numerical problems are present,
                     you will see a warning message to this effect at the end
                     of the triangulation process. Warning: Points arranged on
                     a regular lattice (termed degenerate cases) can be
                     triangulated in more than one way (at least according to
                     the Delaunay criterion). The choice of triangulation (as
                     implemented by this algorithm) depends on the order of the
                     input points. The first three points will form a triangle;
                     other degenerate points will not break this triangle.
                     Points that are coincident (or nearly so) may be discarded
                     by the algorithm. This is because the Delaunay
                     triangulation requires unique input points. The output of
                     the Delaunay triangulation is supposedly a convex hull. In
                     certain cases this implementation may not generate the
                     convex hull.</div>
