                     filter computes isolines or isosurfaces using a selected
                     point-centered scalar array. The Contour filter operates
                     on any type of data set, but the input is required to have
                     at least one point-centered scalar (single-component)
                     array. The output of this filter is
                     polygonal.</div>
