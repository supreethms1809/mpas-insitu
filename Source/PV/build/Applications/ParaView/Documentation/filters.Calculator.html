        <div class="description">
The Calculator filter computes a new data array or new point
coordinates as a function of existing scalar or vector arrays. If
point-centered arrays are used in the computation of a new data array,
the resulting array will also be point-centered. Similarly,
computations using cell-centered arrays will produce a new
cell-centered array. If the function is computing point coordinates,
the result of the function must be a three-component vector.
<p>
The Calculator interface operates similarly to a scientific
calculator. In creating the function to evaluate, the standard order
of operations applies. Each of the calculator functions is described
below. Unless otherwise noted, enclose the operand in parentheses
using the ( and ) buttons.
<ul><li>Clear: Erase the current function (displayed in the read-only text
  box above the calculator buttons).
<li>/: Divide one scalar by another. The operands for this function are
  not required to be enclosed in parentheses.
<li>*: Multiply two scalars, or multiply a vector by a scalar (scalar multiple).
  The operands for this function are not required to be enclosed in parentheses.
<li>-: Negate a scalar or vector (unary minus), or subtract one scalar or vector
  from another. The operands for this function are not required to be enclosed
  in parentheses.
<li>+: Add two scalars or two vectors. The operands for this function are not
  required to be enclosed in parentheses.
<li>sin: Compute the sine of a scalar. cos: Compute the cosine of a scalar.
<li>tan: Compute the tangent of a scalar.
<li>asin: Compute the arcsine of a scalar.
<li>acos: Compute the arccosine of a scalar.
<li>atan: Compute the arctangent of a scalar.
<li>sinh: Compute the hyperbolic sine of a scalar.
<li>cosh: Compute the hyperbolic cosine of a scalar.
<li>tanh: Compute the hyperbolic tangent of a scalar.
<li>min: Compute minimum of two scalars.
<li>max: Compute maximum of two scalars.
<li>x^y: Raise one scalar to the power of another scalar. The operands for
  this function are not required to be enclosed in parentheses.
<li>sqrt: Compute the square root of a scalar.
<li>e^x: Raise e to the power of a scalar.
<li>log: Compute the logarithm of a scalar (deprecated. same as log10).
<li>log10: Compute the logarithm of a scalar to the base 10.
<li>ln: Compute the logarithm of a scalar to the base 'e'.
<li>ceil: Compute the ceiling of a scalar. floor: Compute the floor of a scalar.
<li>abs: Compute the absolute value of a scalar.
<li>v1.v2: Compute the dot product of two vectors. The operands for this
  function are not required to be enclosed in parentheses.
<li>cross: Compute cross product of two vectors.
<li>mag: Compute the magnitude of a vector.
<li>norm: Normalize a vector.</ul>
The operands are described below. The digits 0 - 9 and the decimal
point are used to enter constant scalar values. <b>iHat</b>, <b>jHat</b>,
and <b>kHat</b> are vector constants representing unit vectors in the X,
Y, and Z directions, respectively. The scalars menu lists the names of
the scalar arrays and the components of the vector arrays of either
the point-centered or cell-centered data.  The vectors menu lists the
names of the point-centered or cell-centered vector arrays. The
function will be computed for each point (or cell) using the scalar or
vector value of the array at that point (or cell). The filter operates
on any type of data set, but the input data set must have at least one
scalar or vector array. The arrays can be either point-centered or
cell-centered. The Calculator filter's output is of the same data set
type as the input.</div>
