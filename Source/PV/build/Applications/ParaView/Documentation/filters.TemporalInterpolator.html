        <div class="description">The Temporal
                     Interpolator converts data that is defined at discrete
                     time steps to one that is defined over a continuum of time
                     by linearly interpolating the data's field data between
                     two adjacent time steps. The interpolated values are a
                     simple approximation and should not be interpreted as
                     anything more. The Temporal Interpolator assumes that the
                     topology between adjacent time steps does not
                     change.</div>

                <td>If Discrete Time Step Interval is set to 0, then the
        Temporal Interpolator will provide a continuous region of time on its
        output. If set to anything else, then the output will define a finite
        set of time points on its output, each spaced by the Discrete Time Step
        Interval. The output will have (time range)/(discrete time step
        interval) time steps. (Note that the time range is defined by the time
        range of the data of the input filter, which may be different from
        other pipeline objects or the range defined in the animation
        inspector.) This is a useful option to use if you have a dataset with
        one missing time step and wish to 'file-in' the missing data with an
        interpolated value from the steps on either side.</td>
